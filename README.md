# Face Detection and Tracking

A real-time face detection and tracking system using Haar Cascade classifiers.

## Description
This project detects and tracks human faces in a live video stream. By using Haar Cascade classifiers, it provides accurate and real-time face detection, which can be applied in various domains like security systems, facial recognition, and user interface development.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and tracking.
- Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for robust face detection.
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes and status text.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aniket-Choudhari/Face-Detection-and-Tracking.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd Face-Detection-and-Tracking
3. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
# Usage
  Run the face detection script:
  bash
  python face_detection.py
The script will open a video stream from your camera and display the detection in real-time.
